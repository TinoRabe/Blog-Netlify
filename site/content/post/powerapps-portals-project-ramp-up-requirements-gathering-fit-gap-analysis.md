So let's look at some best practices on how to identify requirements and also some considerations on how to document them. 

 **Portals Standard vs. Requirements**  \
You're up to a good start if you know the Portal functionality very well. And this is template specific, if a template is used. If you leverage the customer self-service template, deep-dive into the template specific Web templates of the solution. If you know all the templates and their unique features, it will be a lot easier to not only choose the right template for your customer needs, but also shape your solution architecturally with out-of-the-box features. Consider to categorize the gathered requirements into at least three categories:

* Standard functionality without customization
* Standard functionality with customization
* Custom functionality

This can make life easier when it comes to comprehend estimated efforts and also maintains a first class documentation of your solution. Put yourself in the shoes of the support staff after the project phase. Wouldn't it be nice to know straight away that a buggy feature is relying on standard functionality? That will make troubleshooting so much easier as reproduction in other (vanilla) environments can be carried out right away.
