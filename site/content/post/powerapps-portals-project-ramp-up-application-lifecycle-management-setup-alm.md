**(1)** Best Practice: Scale ALM setup in dependency to project scale (e.g. enterprise project, small-medium sized project, etc.)

**(2)** Best Practice: Consider at least two groups of stakeholders: You and your customer

**(3)** Best practice: Try to avoid a single-portal approach

**(4)** Best practice: Have your ALM setup strategy in place before the actual requirements delivery starts

> ALM Setup - Introduction

In my years as a functional consultant, I have come worked in projects of different scale:

* Enterprise Business
* Small-Medium sized Business
* One Man Business

Almost in every project, the ALM setup strategy led to some discussion in the beginning of the project. In their essence, these discussions and considerations are not particularly unique to PowerApps Portals projects, but rather to software delivery projects in general. Still, I always bring this topic up in the very beginning of the project and too often the ALM setup strategy has not been considered deep enough by the customer. Hence, I feel this is a crucial factor to a healthy project. Let's start with projects at enterprise scale. Here's a sample illustration, which should not be anything new to you:
