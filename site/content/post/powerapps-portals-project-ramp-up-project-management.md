**(1)** When choosing the project management tool chain, consider enablement of collaboration within your Portals team and outside your team with other project teams. There will always be an intersection.

**(2)** Consider ways to document your Portals configuration, so they can be traced back - both functionally and technically.

**(3)** Create your test data in advance and let it be reproducible in every environment.

**(4)** When running an agile project, consider the ability to independently deploy anytime.

**(5)** Train involved project staff about Power Apps Portals right form the beginning as this will reduce time and efforts during project delivery.

**(6)** Do not underestimate efforts for the transition to operations after a the project ends.
